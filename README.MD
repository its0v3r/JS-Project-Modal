This project is a simples modal window. It was written only using HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

This project is heavily based on John Smilga's Modal project on his HTML/CSS/JS course ([Codding Addict](https://www.youtube.com/c/codingaddict)). But it might have a few or a lot of tweaks and new things added by me.
