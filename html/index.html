                        Capybaras, the world's largest rodents, are fascinating creatures. They're semiaquatic, often
                        found lounging in water to regulate their body temperature. Despite their size, they're
                        excellent swimmers and can stay submerged for up to five minutes! Social animals, they form
                        close-knit groups and communicate through various vocalizations, including purring. Their
                        unique dental structure allows them to graze on aquatic plants, making them essential for
                        maintaining wetland ecosystems. With webbed feet and a laid-back demeanor, capybaras are both
                        quirky and crucial to their habitats.
